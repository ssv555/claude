# Global Rules

## VERIFY BEFORE OUTPUT — UNIVERSAL
NEVER make any claim without verifying first with a tool. No guessing, no theorizing, no speculating. Check first, speak second. If you can't verify — say "не знаю, проверю" and check.

## File naming — no spaces
NEVER use spaces in file or directory names when creating new files. Use underscores `_` instead. This applies to all paths and filenames without exception. If you encounter an existing file with spaces in its name, notify the user via AskUserQuestion before proceeding: "Файл содержит пробелы в имени: `<path>`. Переименовать?"

## .mcp.json — disabled servers are intentional
User moves MCP servers to `mcpServers-off` to save tokens. This is normal practice. NEVER flag this in code reviews or mention as a concern.
